# Flipkart_DBMS_Project2_FSM

This project presents an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Flipkart's e-commerce platform, using a top-down approach to model core entities like Users, Products, Orders, and Payments. It includes a Data Access Language defining departmental access to database entities, ensuring secure and efficient data management. The design is normalized up to Third Normal Form (3NF) and implemented in SQL, providing a robust, scalable database structure to support key e-commerce operations.
